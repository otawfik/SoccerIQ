# SoccerIQ

A premium dark-themed React Native + Expo app for football intelligence — live fixtures, standings, top scorers with FIFA Ultimate Team-style player cards, form-based predictions, and squad intel across the top 5 European leagues and UEFA Champions League.

All data is fetched directly from [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org) from the client — no backend required.

## Features

**Home**
- Live fixtures with score, match status (LIVE / HT / FT), and team crests
- League standings table with position, points, W/D/L, and goal difference
- Upcoming fixtures for the selected league — next 5 scheduled matches with date pill (Today / Tomorrow / weekday) and kick-off time

**Players**
- Top 20 scorers per league, sorted by composite score `(goals × 2) + (assists × 1.5)`
- Relative tier system: S (top 3) · A (4–10) · B (11–20) · C (rest) — so the best players always get S regardless of raw numbers
- Tap any player to open a FIFA Ultimate Team-style card with tier-specific gradient (gold / purple / cyan / green), glow border, stats, club crest, and player photo fetched from Wikipedia

**Predictions**
- Teams ranked by recent form using last 5 match results (W=3, D=1, L=0) ÷ 15
- Form confidence bar, Hot / Warm / Cold label, W/D/L season record
- Falls back to season-wide points-per-game when form string is unavailable

**Squad Intel**
- Full squad rosters for each club in the selected league
- Expandable team cards with player name, position, and nationality
- Note: football-data.org free tier has no dedicated transfers endpoint; this tab uses squad data as intel

## Setup

### 1. Get a free API key

Register at [football-data.org/client/register](https://www.football-data.org/client/register). The free tier covers all 6 supported competitions.

### 2. Add your key to `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

This is already in `.gitignore` — it will not be committed.

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If you hit peer dependency conflicts:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 4. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

Scan the QR code with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on iOS or Android, or press `i` / `a` to open in a simulator.

## Design Tokens

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Background | `#0D0D0D` |
| Card | `#161616` |
| Accent Green | `#00FF87` |
| Accent Blue | `#00C2FF` |
| Accent Purple | `#7B61FF` |

Inspired by Kalshi and Marvel Snap — near-black base, electric accent glows, card layout with sharp typography and linear gradients.

## Notes

- The API key is bundled client-side via `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` — acceptable for personal / dev builds. For a public release, route calls through a server proxy to keep the key private.
- Pull-to-refresh works on all screens.
- The `server/` folder contains a legacy Flask proxy that is no longer used by the app. It can be safely deleted.
